    ('#31', r"Proof. First let v ∈ V be incident to at least three leaves and suppose there is a minimum power dominating set S of G that does not contain v. If S excludes two or more of the leaves of G incident to v, then those leaves cannot be dominated or forced at any step. Thus, S excludes at most one leaf incident to v, which means S contains at least two leaves ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 incident to v. Then, (S\{ℓ 1 , ℓ 2 }) ∪ {v} is a smaller power dominating set than S, which is a contradiction. Now consider the case in which v ∈ V is incident to exactly two leaves, ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 , and suppose there is a minimum power dominating set S of G such that {v, ℓ 1 , ℓ 2 } ∩ S = ∅. Then neither ℓ 1 nor ℓ 2 can be dominated or forced at any step, contradicting the assumption that S is a power dominating set. If S is a power dominating set that contains ℓ 1 or ℓ 2 , say ℓ 1 , then (S\{ℓ 1 }) ∪ {v} is also a power dominating set and has the same cardinality. Applying this to every vertex incident to exactly two leaves produces the minimum power dominating set required by (3). Definition 3.4. Given a graph G = (V, E) and a set X ⊆ V , define ℓ r (G, X) as the graph obtained by attaching r leaves to each vertex in X. If X = {v 1 , . . . , v k }, we denote the r leaves attached to vertex v i as ℓ",

This counterintuitive fi nding can be explained by taking into account the fact that audiences do not watch informative content merely to inform themselves; they have other motivations that might override credibility concerns. For example, they might follow media primarily for entertainment purposes and consequently put less emphasis on the quality of the received information.As <|CITE|> have claimed, audiences tend to approach and process information differently depending on the channel; they approach television primarily for entertainment and newspapers primarily for information. This has implications for trust as well since audiences in an entertainment processing mode will be less attentive to credibility cues, such as news errors, than those in an information processing mode (Ibid.). <|CITE|> research confi rms this claim -he found that audiences tend to approach newspaper reading more actively than television viewing and that credibility assessments differ regarding whether audience members approach news actively or passively. These fi ndings can help explain why we found a weak positive correlation between television news exposure and trust in journalism. It could be that audiences turn to television not because they expect the best quality information but rather the opposite -namely, that they approach television news less critically, focus less attention on credibility concerns and, therefore, develop a higher degree of trust in journalism. The fact that those respondents who follow the commercial television channel POP TV and the tabloid Slovenske Novice exhibit a higher trust in journalistic objectivity compared to those respondents who do not follow these media is also in line with this interpretation. The topic of Janez Janša and exposure to media that are favourable to him and his SDS party is negatively connected to trust in journalism. This phenomenon can be partly explained by the elaboration likelihood model <|CITE|> , according to which highly involved individuals tend to process new information in a way that maintains and confi rms their original opinion by 1) taking information consistent with their views (information that falls within a narrow range of acceptance) as simply veridical and embracing it, and 2) judging counter-attitudinal information to be the product of biased, misguided or ill-informed sources and rejecting it <|CITE|> <|CITE|> .
