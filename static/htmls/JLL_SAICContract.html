Services (“<strong>Price</strong>” or “<strong>Pricing</strong>” or “<strong>Compensation</strong>”) included in this SOW are detailed in this Exhibit and exclude all applicable taxes per the Agreement.  </p><p>The following rates apply upon the effective date of the Agreement and shall remain in effect for the term through May 31, 2025 (“Term”) or until otherwise mutually agreed to by both Manager and Service Contractor.  All prices, rates and mark-ups set forth herein are fixed for the duration of the Contract Duties and include all Service Contractor’s costs, expenses, overhead and profit for complete performance of the Contract Duties in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement.  Should there be a significant increase in the cost of overhead and profit, Service Contractor will provide appropriate documentation to support an increase and provided the increase is approved by Manager, such increase shall not exceed three percent (3%) on an annual basis.</p><p>Note: Manager’s expectation is that Contract Duties performed under this Agreement will not give rise to statutory lien rights. Service Contractor must notify Manager if the Contract Duties could give rise to statutory lien rights for any Facility prior to performance of the Contract Duties. Manager may require conditional and final lien waivers as part of the invoice submission process.</p><h2><a id="_Toc42175761"></a>Billing Process</h2><p>Service Contractor will invoice Manager, as outlined in the Service Contractor Invoice Presentment Form below.</p><h3>New Equipment Pricing</h3><p>All new Equipment Pricing (including base configurations and accessories) is detailed in Table B-1 below.  Such Pricing consists of (1) an Equipment Monthly Minimum Charge (“<strong>MMC</strong>”) and (2) the Price charged per Impression made by Equipment (“<strong>PPI</strong>” or “<strong>Price Per Impression</strong>”, which may also be referred to as “<strong>Additional Impression Charge</strong>” on Orders).  The Equipment MMC covers Manager’s use of the Equipment for a committed term of sixty (60) months (“<strong>Lease Term</strong>”) from the date of install.  Depending on the Capabilities of the Equipment, the PPI charge will consist of two (2) components: (i) a PPI charge for Impressions produced in black and white (monochrome) and in the absence of any other color (“<strong>B/W Impressions</strong>”), and/or (ii) a PPI charge for Impressions that are not B/W Impressions (“<strong>Color Impressions</strong>”).  For the avoidance of doubt a combination of B/W Impressions and Color Impressions on a single Impression shall be considered as Color Impressions. The PPI charge includes Consumable Supplies, and the portion of the maintenance charge that varies by Impression Volume.</p><h3>New Equipment Billing</h3><p>Service Contractor shall invoice Manager for new Equipment monthly, with charges determined by (i) multiplying the actual quantities of Equipment in the Output Environment by the applicable MMC shown in Table B-1, plus (ii) the actual Impression Volumes run on such Equipment multiplied by the applicable PPI charge(s) for each type of Impression.  Equipment that is installed during the month will have their MMC pro-rated based on the date of installation.</p><h3>Device Services Pricing</h3><p>Table B-2 shows the applicable Monthly Services charges based on the expected number of Devices supported.  The final number of Devices supported will be determined by Devices installed or remaining within the Output environment per the Facility Plans at the completion of Transformation.  Other services, as requested and mutually agreed upon via the Change Control Process will be priced and added to the invoice as set forth in the authorized change.</p><h2><a id="_Toc42175762"></a>Retained Existing Equipment</h2><p>Equipment which are leased, rented or owned by the Manager outside of the Agreement, and which remain subject solely to the terms and conditions of the agreements under which they were originally acquired, constitutes “<strong>Existing Equipment</strong>.”  </p><p>Service Contractor may perform certain Services for Existing Equipment, that are agreed to be In-Scope as outlined in the Exhibit A-1 Facility and Device Listing under this SOW, including Service Desk, Supplies Management, Break Fix Management (excluding SLAs outlined in this SOW), MACD, Governance and Reporting.   All Existing Equipment shall remain on their current agreement(s) and continue to be invoiced separately under such agreement(s).  Early removal of any Existing Equipment is subject to the early termination charges or other charges set out in such agreements for the Existing Equipment, as such termination is permitted thereunder.</p><h2><a id="_Toc42175763"></a>Retained Devices</h2><p>Any remaining liabilities on existing devices may limit Service Contractor’s ability to remove or replace such existing devices, which may affect the Facility Plan.  In order for such existing devices to receive any of the Services under this SOW, said existing devices must be listed under Exhibit A-1 Facility and Device Listing.</p><p><strong>Table B-1: New Equipment Price List</strong></p><p>Manager may add Equipment at the prices stated in the table below (“<strong>Price List</strong>”).  Any balances refinanced from a prior agreement and any applicable early termination charges may be added to such prices as and when applicable.  Products that (i) are not included on the Price List, (ii) are added for a term other than those specified in the Price List, or (iii) are added with a different accessory configuration, will be at the mutually agreed upon prices set forth in the applicable Order.  The Price List is effective for Orders placed during the Term.

Services may also include (i) Xerox-brand equipment (“Equipment”) and Xerox-brand software including without limitation Base Software, Services Software and Application Software (collectively “Software”); (ii) third party hardware (“Third Party Hardware”) and/or third party software (“Third Party Software”) (collectively, “Third Party Products”); and/or (iii) Maintenance Services, as set forth herein, for Equipment and/or equipment maintenance for Third Party Hardware.  “Deliverables” include, but are not limited to, Products, Assessments and Documentation.  As used herein, (i) “Products” refers collectively to supplies, maintenance, Equipment, Software and Third Party Products hereunder; (ii) “Assessments” are assessment and recommendation reports created as a result of Xerox performance of assessment services; and, (iii) “Documentation” shall mean all manuals, brochures, specifications, information and software descriptions, in electronic, printed, and/or camera-ready form, and related materials customarily provided by Xerox for use as part of the Offerings.</li></ol></li><li><strong>REMOTE SERVICES.  </strong>Certain models of Equipment are supported and serviced using data that is automatically collected by Xerox from, or transmitted to or from Xerox by, Equipment or Third Party Products connected to Customer’s network (“Remote Data”) via electronic transmission to a secure off-site location (“Remote Data Access”).  Remote Data Access also enables Xerox to transmit to Customer Maintenance Releases (defined below) or upgrades for software or firmware and to remotely diagnose and modify Equipment to repair or correct malfunctions.  Examples of Remote Data include product registration, meter read, supply level, equipment configuration and settings, software version, and problem/fault code data.  Remote Data may also be collected by the Xerox Tools and certain Services Software as set forth in the applicable SOW.  Remote Data will be transmitted to and from Customer in a secure manner specified by Xerox.  Remote Data Access will not allow Xerox to read, view or download any Customer data, documents or other information residing on or passing through the Equipment, Third Party Hardware or Customer’s information management systems.  Customer grants the right to Xerox, without charge, to establish and maintain Remote Data Access for the purposes described above.  Upon Xerox’s request, Customer will provide contact information for Equipment such as name and address of Customer contact and IP and physical addresses/locations of Equipment.  Customer will enable Remote Data Access via a method prescribed by Xerox and Customer will provide Xerox with reasonable assistance to allow Xerox to have Remote Data Access.  Unless Xerox deems Equipment incapable of Remote Data Access, Customer will ensure that Remote Data Access is maintained at all times Maintenance Services are being performed.</li><li><strong>VOLUME REVIEW.</strong>  At Customer’s request, the parties may meet annually to review the volume of prints for Equipment for the previous 12 months under one or more Orders based on reporting provided by Xerox.  Based on said review, the parties may mutually agree to revise the Prints Included in Minimum and the associated MMC in said Order(s).</li><li><strong>MAINTENANCE SERVICES.</strong>  Unless otherwise stated, Xerox (or a designated servicer) will provide the following Maintenance Services, which may also be referred to as “Break/Fix Services”, under an Order for Equipment (unless Customer is acquiring Equipment for which Xerox does not offer Maintenance Services; such Equipment to be designated as “No Svc.”).  The provision of Maintenance Services is contingent upon Customer facilitating timely and efficient resolution of Equipment issues by: (a) utilizing Customer-implemented remedies provided by Xerox; (b) replacing Cartridges; and (c) providing information to and implementing recommendations provided by Xerox telephone support personnel in those instances where Xerox is not providing on-site Equipment support personnel.  If an Equipment issue is not resolved after completion of (a) through (c) above, Xerox will provide on-site support as provided in the applicable Order.<ol><li>REPAIRS &amp; PARTS.  Xerox will make repairs and adjustments necessary to keep Equipment in good working order (including such repairs or adjustments required during initial installation).  Parts required for repair may be new, reprocessed, or recovered.</li><li>.	HOURS &amp; EXCLUSIONS.  Unless otherwise stated, Maintenance Services will be provided during Xerox's standard working hours (excluding Xerox-recognized holidays) in areas within the United States, its territories, and possessions open for repair service for the Equipment at issue.  Customer agrees to give Xerox reasonable access to the Equipment.  Maintenance Services shall cover repairs and adjustments required as a result of normal wear and tear or defects in materials or workmanship (and shall exclude repairs or adjustments Xerox determines to relate to or be affected by the use of options, accessories, or other connected products not serviced by Xerox, as well as any non-Xerox alterations, relocation, service, supplies, or consumables).</li><li>.	INSTALLATION SITE &amp; METER READINGS.  The Equipment installation site must conform to Xerox's published requirements throughout the term of an Order.  If applicable, Customer agrees to provide meter readings in the manner prescribed by Xerox.  If Customer does not provide Xerox with meter readings as required, for Equipment not capable of Remote Data Access, or if Remote Data Access is interrupted, Xerox may estimate them and bill Customer accordingly.</li><li>.	EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT.  As Customer’s exclusive remedy for Xerox’s failure to provide Maintenance Services, Xerox will for 5 years after the installation date of the initial unit or the initial term of the Order, whichever is longer, replace the Equipment with an identical product or, at Xerox’s option, another product of equal or greater capabilities.  If the replacement product is provided pursuant to this Section, there shall be no additional charge for Maintenance Services during the initial term of the applicable Order and the replacement product shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the MSA.  If Xerox is unable to keep a unit of Equipment in good working order after the period noted above, either party may terminate Maintenance Services for that unit without penalty or early termination charges upon not less than 30 days written notice to the other party.</li><li>.	CARTRIDGES. If Xerox is providing Maintenance Services for Equipment utilizing cartridges designated by Xerox as customer-replaceable units, including copy/print cartridges and xerographic modules or fuser modules (“Cartridges”), Customer agrees to use only unmodified Cartridges purchased directly from Xerox or its authorized resellers in the United States and the failure to use such Cartridges shall void any warranty applicable to such Equipment.  Cartridges packed with Equipment and replacement Cartridges may be new, remanufactured or reprocessed.  Remanufactured and reprocessed Cartridges meet Xerox's new Cartridge performance standards and contain new and/or reprocessed components.  To enhance print quality, the Cartridge(s) for many models of Equipment have been designed to cease functioning at a predetermined point.  In addition, many Equipment models are designed to function only with Cartridges that are newly manufactured original Xerox Cartridges or with Cartridges intended for use in the U.S.  Equipment configuration that permits use of non-newly manufactured original Xerox Cartridges may be available from Xerox at an additional charge.</li><li>.	PC/WORKSTATION REQUIREMENTS. In order to receive Maintenance Services and/or Software Support for Equipment requiring connection to a PC or workstation, Customer must utilize a PC or workstation that either (i) has been provided by Xerox or (ii) meets Xerox’s published specifications.</li></ol></li><li><strong>CONSUMABLE SUPPLIES INCLUDED (IN MONTHLY MINIMUM / IMPRESSION OR PRINT CHARGES).</strong>  Consumable Supplies vary depending upon the Equipment model, and include: (i) for black and white Equipment, standard black toner and/or dry ink, black developer, Copy Cartridges, and, if applicable, fuser agent required to make impressions; (ii) for full color Equipment, the items in (i) plus standard cyan, magenta, and yellow toners and dry inks (and their associated developers); and, (iii) for Equipment identified as “Phaser”, only, if applicable, black solid ink, color solid ink, imaging units, waste cartridges, transfer rolls, transfer belts, transfer units, belt cleaner, maintenance kits, print Cartridges, drum Cartridges, waste trays and cleaning kits.  Unless otherwise set forth in an Order, Consumable Supplies excludes paper and staples.  Xerox may charge a shipping fee for Consumable Supplies.  Customer agrees that the Consumable Supplies are Xerox's property until used by Customer, that Customer will use them only with the Equipment under the applicable Order, that Customer will return all Cartridges to Xerox for remanufacturing once they have been run to their cease-function point and that Customer will either return any unused Consumable Supplies to Xerox, at Xerox’s expense when using Xerox-supplied shipping labels, at the end of the term of the applicable Equipment Order or destroy them in a manner permitted by applicable law.  Should Customer’s use of Consumable Supplies exceed Xerox’s published Consumable Supplies yields for these items by more than 10%, Customer agrees that Xerox shall have the right to charge Customer for any such excess usage.  When requested by Xerox, Customer shall provide an inventory of Consumable Supplies in its possession and meter readings.</li><li><strong>EQUIPMENT STATUS.</strong>  Unless Customer is acquiring Previously Installed Equipment, Equipment will be either: (a) “Newly Manufactured”, which may contain some recycled components that are reconditioned; (b) “Factory Produced New Model”, which is manufactured and newly serialized at a Xerox factory, adds functions and features to a product previously disassembled to a Xerox predetermined standard, and contains both new components and recycled components that are reconditioned; or, (c) “Remanufactured”, which has been factory produced following disassembly to a Xerox predetermined standard and contains both new components and recycled components that are reconditioned.
