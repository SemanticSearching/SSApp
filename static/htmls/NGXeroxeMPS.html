Non-standard delivery or removal charges (including removal prior to the end of the term for any Equipment) will be subject to Customer’s prior written approval and expense. </p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Equipment Status</strong><a id="_Hlk29374001"></a></li></ol></li></ul><p>Unless Customer is acquiring previously installed equipment, Equipment will be either: (a) “Newly Manufactured,” which may contain some recycled components that are reconditioned; (b) “Factory Produced New Model” which is manufactured and newly serialized at a Xerox factory, adds functions and features to a product previously disassembled to a Xerox predetermined standard, and contains new components and recycled components that are reconditioned; or (c) “Remanufactured,” which has been factory produced following disassembly to a Xerox predetermined standard and contains both new components and recycled components that are reconditioned. Xerox makes no representations as to the status of any Third-Party Hardware that Xerox may provide under any Order. Customer authorizes Xerox or its agent to file financing statements necessary to protect Xerox’s rights as lessor of Equipment. All equipment, regardless of status, will need to follow Chain of Custody requirements referenced in Section 64 of the Agreement.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Consumable Supplies</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>As provided in the SOW, Xerox will provide Consumable Supplies for related Equipment. If Customer requests expedited delivery for functioning Equipment, Xerox may charge a shipping fee for Consumable Supplies. Consumable Supplies are Xerox’s property until used in the Equipment for which they are provided. Upon expiration or termination of the applicable Order, Customer will either return any unused Consumable Supplies to Xerox at Xerox’s expense when using Xerox-supplied shipping labels or destroy them in a manner permitted by applicable law. Xerox reserves the right to charge Customer for any Consumable Supplies usage that exceeds Xerox’s published yields by more than 10%. In such a case, Xerox will notify Customer of the excess usage. If such excess usage does not cease within 30 days after notice, Xerox may charge Customer for the excess usage. </p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Use and Relocation</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>For any Equipment or Third Party Hardware provided by Xerox, with the exception of Purchased Equipment for which Customer has paid in full, Customer agrees that: (a) the Equipment or Third Party Hardware shall remain personal property; (b) Customer will not attach any of the Equipment or Third Party Hardware as a fixture to any real estate; (c) Customer will not pledge, sub-lease or part with possession of the Equipment or Third Party Hardware or file or permit to be filed any lien against the Equipment or Third Party Hardware; and (d) Customer will not make any permanent alterations to the Equipment or Third Party Hardware. While Equipment or Third-Party Hardware is subject to an Order, Customer must provide Xerox prior written notice of all Equipment or Third-Party Hardware relocations and Xerox may arrange to relocate the Equipment or Third-Party Hardware at Customer’s expense. While Equipment or Third-Party Hardware is being relocated, Customer remains responsible for making all payments to Xerox required under the applicable Order.  Without limiting Customer’s right to purchase information storage devices under 4.7, all parts or materials replaced, including as part of an upgrade, will become Xerox’s property. Equipment or Third-Party Hardware cannot be relocated outside of the U.S. until Customer has paid in full for the Equipment or Third-Party Hardware and has received title thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, to the extent the Equipment contains any Software, any relocation of such Equipment is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this of this Agreement.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Seller Equipment Provided</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>In the event Xerox provides Seller Equipment to Customer, the following terms shall apply unless otherwise specified in an Order:</p><p>a.	Unless Seller Equipment is purchased by Customer, Xerox (or the applicable third party vendor) shall at all times retain title to the Seller Equipment. Customer hereby authorizes Xerox or its agents to file financing statements necessary to protect Xerox’s rights to the Seller Equipment. Customer will promptly notify Xerox, in writing, of any change in ownership, or if it relocates its principal place of business or changes the name of its business. The risk of loss or damage to the Seller Equipment shall pass to Customer upon delivery to the applicable Customer Facilities, except for Xerox’s assumption of the risk of loss during relocations. Customer will insure the Seller Equipment against loss or damage.</p><p>b.	Subject to any agreements in a SOW regarding Xerox performing all Maintenance Services, Customer agrees to use the Seller Equipment in accordance with, and to perform, all operator maintenance procedures for the Seller Equipment described in the applicable Documentation made available or provided by Xerox. The Customer shall not (unless the Seller Equipment is Purchased Equipment, and then only with Xerox’s prior consent):</p><ol><li>sell, charge, let or part with possession of the Seller Equipment;</li><li>remove the Seller Equipment from Customer Facilities in which it is installed without prior approval and/or coordination with Seller ; or</li><li>make any unauthorized changes or additions to the Seller Equipment.</li></ol><p>c.	<strong>Early Termination. </strong></p><p>Upon termination/removal, Customer shall either make the subject Equipment (in the same condition as when delivered, reasonable wear and tear excepted) and its Software available for removal by Xerox, within a reasonable timeframe, of being requested to do so or purchase the subject Equipment “AS IS WHERE IS’ and WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY AS TO CONDITION OR VALUE by paying Xerox the Fair Market (“FMV”) of the Equipment at its conclusion. </p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Data Security</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>Certain models of Equipment can be configured to include a variety of data security features. There may be an additional cost associated with certain data security features if not listed in Exhibit B. The selection, suitability and approval of data security features are solely Customer’s responsibility. Once approved, Seller shall have responsibility for configuration. Upon request, Xerox will provide additional information to Customer regarding the security features available for particular Equipment models. Obligations regarding removal of Customer’s Confidential Information that may be stored on hard drives on Equipment owned by Xerox, if any, and any costs associated with such removal will be set forth in Exhibit B of the Corporate Award.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Remote Services for Equipment</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>Certain models of Equipment are supported and serviced using Remote Data Access. Remote Data Access also enables Xerox to transmit to Customer Maintenance Releases or Updates for software or firmware and to remotely diagnose and modify Equipment to repair or correct malfunctions. Remote Data will be transmitted to and from Customer in a secure manner specified by Xerox. Remote Data Access will not allow Xerox to read, view or download any Customer data, documents or other information residing on or passing through the Equipment, Third Party Hardware or Customer’s information management systems. Customer grants the right to Xerox, without charge, to establish and maintain Remote Data Access for the purposes described above. Upon Xerox’s request, Customer will provide contact information for Equipment such as name and address of Customer contact and IP and physical addresses/locations of Equipment. Customer will enable Remote Data Access via a method prescribed by Xerox and Customer will provide Xerox with reasonable assistance to allow Xerox to have Remote Data Access. Unless Xerox deems Equipment incapable of Remote Data Access, Customer will ensure that Remote Data Access is maintained at all times Maintenance Services are being performed.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Removal of Hazardous Waste</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>Customer agrees to take responsibility for legally disposing of all hazardous wastes generated from the use of Third-Party Hardware or supplies.</p><ol><li><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIC TO MAINTENANCE SERVICES</strong></li></ol><p>In addition to the terms and conditions in the Corporate Award for Enterprise Managed Print Services (eMPS), and except as set forth in an Order, the following terms and conditions apply to the provision of Maintenance Services.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Maintenance Services</strong><a id="_Hlk29374678"></a></li></ol></li></ul><p>As part of an Order for (a) stand-alone Maintenance Services related to Purchased Equipment, or (b) Maintenance Services related to Equipment to which Xerox does not hold title, or as a mandatory part of an Order for Equipment (other than Purchased Equipment) that includes Maintenance Services, Xerox or a designated service provider will provide the following Maintenance Services for Equipment. If Customer is acquiring Equipment for which Xerox does not offer Maintenance Services, such Equipment will be designated as “No Svc.” This Module does not apply to maintenance of Third-Party Hardware. Maintenance that Xerox provides on Third Party Hardware will be provided in accordance with the terms of the applicable Order.</p><p>The provision of Maintenance Services is contingent upon Customer facilitating timely and efficient resolution of Equipment issues by: (i) utilizing Customer-implemented remedies provided by Xerox; (ii) replacing Cartridges; and (iii) providing information to and implementing recommendations provided by Xerox telephone support personnel in those instances where Xerox is not providing on-site Equipment support personnel. If an Equipment issue is not resolved after completion of (i) through (iii) above, Xerox will provide on-site support as provided in the applicable Order.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Repairs and Parts</strong></li></ol></li></ul><ol><li>Xerox will make repairs and adjustments necessary to keep the Equipment in good working order and operating in accordance with its written specifications (including such repairs or adjustments required during initial installation). Maintenance Services shall cover repairs and adjustments required as a result of normal wear and tear or defects in materials or workmanship. Parts required for repair may be new, reconditioned, reprocessed or recovered.</li><li>Failure to use Xerox authorized or provided Cartridges may void any warranty applicable to such Equipment. Cartridges packed with Equipment or furnished by Xerox as Consumable Supplies will meet Xerox’s new Cartridge performance standards and may be new, remanufactured or reprocessed and contain new and/or reprocessed components. To enhance print quality, Cartridges for many models of Equipment have been designed to cease functioning at a predetermined point. Many Equipment models are designed to function only with Cartridges that are newly manufactured original Xerox Cartridges or with Cartridges intended for use in the country where originally provided.<ol><li><strong>Hours and Exclusions</strong><a id="_Hlk29374725"></a></li></ol></li></ol><p>Unless otherwise set forth in the SOW, Maintenance Services will be provided in areas accessible for repair services during Xerox’s standard working hours. Maintenance Services excludes repairs due to: (a) misuse, neglect or abuse; (b) failure of the installation site or the PC or workstation used with the Equipment to comply with Xerox’s published specifications; (c) use of options, accessories, or other products not serviced by Xerox; (d) non-Xerox alterations, relocation, service or supplies; and (e) failure to perform operator maintenance procedures identified in operator manuals. Customer agrees to furnish all referenced parts, tools, and supplies needed to perform those procedures that are described in the applicable manuals and instructions.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Installation Site and Meter Readings</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>In order to receive Maintenance Services for Equipment requiring connection to a PC or workstation, Customer must utilize a PC or workstation that either (a) has been provided by Xerox or (b) meets Xerox’s published specifications. The Equipment installation site must conform to Xerox’s published requirements. If applicable, unless otherwise set forth in Exhibit A, Customer agrees to provide meter readings in the manner prescribed by Xerox. If Customer does not provide Xerox with meter readings as required, for Equipment not capable of Remote Data Access, or if Remote Data Access is interrupted, Xerox may estimate them and bill Customer accordingly.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Remedy</strong><a id="_Hlk29374492"></a></li></ol></li></ul><p>As Customer’s exclusive remedy for Xerox’s failure to provide Maintenance Services, Xerox will, for: (i) 5 years after the installation date of the initial unit or such longer period as may be set forth in the SOW (subject in all events to EOS limitations on the ability to provide Maintenance Services),  or (ii) the initial term of the Order, whichever is longer, replace the Equipment with an identical product or, at Xerox’s option, another model with comparable features and capabilities. If replacement Equipment is provided pursuant to this Section, there shall be no additional charge for its provision by Xerox during the initial term of the Order and it shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Order(s). Customer’s use of non-Xerox approved consumables that affect the performance of the Equipment may invalidate this remedy.</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>End of Service</strong></li></ol></li></ul><p>Xerox has no obligation to maintain or replace Equipment beyond the “End of Service” for that particular model of Equipment. End of Service (“EOS”) means the date announced by Xerox after which Xerox will no longer offer Maintenance Services for a particular Equipment model. An EOS Equipment List is available upon request.</p><ol><li><strong> TERMS AND CONDITIONS SPECIFIC TO SOFTWARE</strong></li></ol><p>In addition to the terms and conditions in the Corporate Award for Enterprise Managed Print Services (eMPS), the following terms and conditions apply to the license and use of Software and its associated Documentation. </p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Software License</strong></li></ol></li></ul><ol><li>Xerox may provide Software to Customer pursuant to the Award and the Exhibits or an Order hereunder.
